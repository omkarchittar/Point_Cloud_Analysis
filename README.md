## **Installation and Running**

1. Download and extract the files.

2. Run the code Problem_2.py using the following command in your terminal
    ***python3 Problem_2.py***
   It contains the code for both the subquestions.
SEVEN pop up windows:
**window 1**: Visualization of the surface normal to pc1.
**window 2**: Standard Least Square fitting for pc1.
**window 3**: Standard Least Square fitting for pc2.
**window 4**: Total Least Square fitting for pc1.
**window 5**: Total Least Square fitting for pc2.
**window 6**: RANSAC for pc1.
**window 7**: RANSAC for pc2.
**The terminal displays the following**:
 - Covariance Matrix. 
 - Eigenvalues of covariance matrix.
 - Direction and Magnitude of the surface normal.
 - Equation of the Plane for RANSAC on pc1 and its inliers.
 - Equation of the Plane for RANSAC on pc2 and its inliers.

***(All the figures in pop up windows are also saved in the figures folder)***

3. A detailed report of the entire project is given in ***report.pdf***
